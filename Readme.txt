Run Rain.py to run the program.

It requires pygame!

Rain is a game similar to asteroids where you fly a space ship and collect space crystals and space pods and return them to the space station.  There might be more added later. 

The controls are:
Left/Right Arrow Keys to rotate your ship left or right.
Up/Down Arrow Keys to accelerate your ship forward or in reverse.
Space Bar to shoot a laser beam.
'D' Key to dock with the space station when you are in range.

Have fun!

Run Rain.py to run the program.

It requires pygame!

Rain is a game similar to asteroids where you fly a space ship and collect space crystals and space pods and return them to the space station.  There might be more added later. 

The controls are:
•Escape Key to quit.
•Left/Right Arrow Keys to rotate your ship left or right.
•Up/Down Arrow Keys to accelerate your ship forward or in reverse.
•Space Bar to fire the main weapon.
•Left Shift to fire the alternate weapon (not implemented atm).
•'D' Key to dock with the space station when you are in range.
•'F' and 'G' Keys to cycle through the focus list. You can dock with the current focus if it is a space station.
•'T' and 'Y' Keys to cycle through the target list. You can fire on the current target even if it isn't hostile.

Have fun!
